About
========

History
-------

This project was started by Alex Eftimiades in 2019 as part of an
internal R&D effort focused on model monitoring and sensitivity
analysis. With early usage, testing, and utility contributions from
Dwight Gunning, Matthew Gillett, and Mona Annaparthi, this lead to the ``supervisor``
submodule and many of the initial ideas that became the
``thresholding``, ``sobol``, and ``credibility`` modules. Subsequent
work on explainability lead to ``interprenet`` and the normalized
mutual information score within ``metrics``.
